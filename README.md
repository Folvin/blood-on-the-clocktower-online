## what is this

this is a setup for nextjs with redux, tailwind and typescript and other libraries or implementation that i personally find usefull like:
- @tailwindcss/typography and tailwindcss-animate
- clsx and tailwind-merge (with a cn function to use both in src/lib/utils)
- shadcn (with button and input component)
- lucide-react
- react-loading-skeleton

there is a bit of setup on the redux folder with 2 custom hooks to use the redux hooks (useSelector and useDispatch) but with types. <br/>
the store provider is passed on the layout.tsx inside the app folder using a custom component that can be found in the redux folder called provider.tsx

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
